# **Frontend Technical Specifications**

## **Business Goal**

A language learning school wants to build a prototype learning portal that will serve three primary functions:

- **Vocabulary Inventory:** A repository of possible vocabulary that can be learned.
- **Learning Record Store (LRS):** A system to track correct and incorrect vocabulary practice scores.
- **Unified Launchpad:** A centralized interface to access various learning applications.

You have been tasked with creating the frontend API of the application.
The fractional CTO has made strong recommendation that you settle on a frontend stack that is being commonly adopted and optimized for AI prototyping services.

The frontend application should powered by my backend API.(prompt fot tech spec)

Technical Restrictions:
The technical stack should be the following:
Typescript (statically typed javascript)
Tailwind CSS (css framework)
Vite.js (frontend tool)
ShadCN (UI components)
